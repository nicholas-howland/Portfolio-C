# C Portfolio
C programming language portfolio created during a C and Unix programming college course. The following are programs that are contianed in this repo and their purposes.

## compile.sh
All important compile script, generated by GPT but customized by me. Requires the lib folder and and a 00-template.c file is prefered, help is shown when incorrect options are supplied. The flag -n will copy the template file to a new .c file in the lib directory based on the name supplied after the flag, the -e flag works similarly however instead of copying a 00-template file it will just edit the .c file of the name supplied after the flag. The script will then attempt to compile the c source after being edited in an editor \( this is set to nano for newer users, if you know what you are doing and want to use another editor then this can be changed in the EDITOR_CMD variuble to be whatever is desired \)

## arrays.c
Using both indexes and pointers to traverse arrays

## dynamic-arrays.c
Creating dynamic arrays through the use of memalloc realloc and sentinal values as well as through the use of defined array lengths

## loops.c
Using loops like while and for to count numbers

## pointers.c
Using pointers to assign values to memory addresses, printing memory addresses of both pointer locations as well as destinations

## if-statements.c
